## Meeting Our Goals
When Prompt began, our goal was always to get the word out. The best way to do that is to take the message to the people most in need. Since we are dedicated to ending the stigma of mental health in tech, that means conferences.

This year, for the first time, Prompt has begun to be a small sponsor at conferences where one of our representatives was present. Our first event was [ElixirDaze](http://www.elixirdaze.com/) in St. Augustine, Florida. The 100 person event focused on the Elixir language and was organized by myself and Johnny Winn. Prompt sponsored and distributed stickers to attendees. I also gave a brief talk on Prompt, what we do, and how people can help. As we've come to find, this started many conversations on the topic of mental health.

## A Different Forum

Throughout the past year, we have had companies reach out to have speakers come directly to their offsites or inservices. We've had speakers go to places like [Dyn](http://dyn.com/) and [MassTLC](http://www.masstlc.org/) to address audiences directly on the subject and we've seen success.

Additionally, we've seen lots of people giving talks on mental health at meet-ups around the globe. Some speakers, such as [Julia Nguyen](https://twitter.com/fleurchild) have spread the word from coast to coast in the US while under the Prompt banner. Other folks, such as [Jason Charnes](https://twitter.com/jmcharnes), have taken up the mantle and started speaking about the subject on their own. Seeing this happen at the local, small-group level has been a huge boost, not only in getting the conversation started, but also in pride that this subject is slowly coming out of the shadows.

Prompt has also reached out and seen some success in getting people to share their stories on our [blog](http://mhprompt.org/blog/index.html). We're always looking for contributors, whether they be seasoned pros, or just someone wanting to share their story (publicly or anonymously) with our readers and followers.

## What's Next?

This autumn, Prompt is the sponsor of [CodeDaze](http://codedaze.io), a conference dedicated to everything tech. Two Prompt speakers, [Justine Arreche](https://twitter.com/SaltineJustine) and [Caleb Thompson](https://twitter.com/calebthompson) will be speaking on subjects of dealing with mental health issues and methods to help. Additionally, Prompt will have stickers and t-shirts and we will continue to get the word out.

## How It's Done

None of this would be possible without our team at the [Travis Foundation](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/), who make our lives easier by handling the business side of things. We are extremely grateful for their help.
