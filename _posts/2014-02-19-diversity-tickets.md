To make this conference even more wonderful [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.com) is sponsoring discounts for underrepresented minorities in our community - e.g. women, LGBT people, people of color, people with disabilities etc.

"Increasing diversity in tech is something both my co-organizer Uğur Özyılmazel and I feel strongly about. We're excited about the Travis Foundation initiative and feel that it matches the idea behind our conference - sharing the joy of programming." -[Floor Drees](https://twitter.com/floordrees), co-organizer of kod.io

*To make our community even more wonderful, we aim to work towards more diversity in tech. We want to support many wonderful projects, build resources and work together with other foundations, initiatives and conferences towards this goal. This discount is one of our first ideas and we'd love continue working in this direction and try to think of different ways and possibilities to foster diversity.*
